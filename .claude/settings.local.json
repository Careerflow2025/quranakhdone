NEW production schema uses ''owner'' role, not ''school_admin''.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\n- Database enum (role type): ''owner'', ''admin'', ''teacher'', ''student'', ''parent''\n- Code was using OLD schema terminology: ''school_admin'' \n- Auth user created with user_metadata.role=''school_admin'' (invalid)\n- Profile INSERT used role=''owner'' (correct) but auth metadata mismatched\n- Login switch case checked for ''school_admin'' which never matched\n\nFixes Applied:\n1. Line 73: Changed user_metadata.role from ''school_admin'' â†’ ''owner''\n2. Line 375-376: Updated login switch to handle both ''owner'' and ''admin'' cases\n3. Now consistent across: auth.users metadata, profiles table, and login logic\n\nFiles Modified:\n- frontend/lib/supabase-auth-service.ts:\n  * createSchoolWithAdmin: user_metadata now uses ''owner'' role\n  * loginWithRole: switch case now handles ''owner''|''admin'' roles\n\nError Resolved: \"Profile not found. Please contact support or complete registration\"\n\nFlow Now Works: School creation â†’ Auth user â†’ Profile â†’ Login âœ“\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
