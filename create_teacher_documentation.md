**Email searched**: quick.teacher@quranakh.test

**Finding**: Account NOT created in database despite successful form submission

### ‚ùå Login Test FAILED
**Error**: Navigation timeout of 60000 ms exceeded
**Reason**: Cannot login with credentials that don't exist

## Analysis

### Possible Causes
1. **Frontend Validation Failed**: Form may have client-side validation that prevented submission
2. **API Error**: Backend endpoint may have rejected the request
3. **Silent Failure**: Form submitted but API returned error without visible feedback
4. **Missing Required Field**: Some field may be required that we didn't fill
5. **Modal Not Closed**: Submission may not have actually occurred

### Next Steps
1. Check screenshot `form-filled-teacher.png` for visual errors
2. Add error message detection to test script
3. Add network request monitoring
4. Check if modal closed after "submit"
5. Verify submit button actually triggered form submission

## Screenshots
- `overview-quick-actions.png` - Overview page with buttons
- `after-add-teacher-click.png` - Form modal visible
- `form-filled-teacher.png` - All fields filled before submit

## Test Code Location
`test_dashboards_final.js` - Lines 79-200 (teacher creation phase)

## Status
üî¥ **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed with teacher dashboard testing until account creation works

## Recommendation
Update test to:
1. Detect and log any error messages after submission
2. Verify modal actually closes (successful submission indicator)
3. Add console.log monitoring for API errors
4. Take screenshot after submission to see final state
