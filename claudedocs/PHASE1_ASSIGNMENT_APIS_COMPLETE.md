  title: string;
  description?: string;
  due_at: string; // ISO 8601
  highlight_refs?: string[];
  attachments?: string[];
}
```
**Response**: Created assignment with ID
**Side Effects**:

- Inserts attachments if provided
- No notification (assignment not viewed yet)

##### **Endpoint 2: GET /api/assignments**
**Purpose**: List assignments with filters
**Auth**: Authenticated users
**Query Parameters**:
```typescript
{
  student_id?: string;
  teacher_id?: string;
  status?: AssignmentStatus | AssignmentStatus[];
  late_only?: boolean;
  due_before?: string;
  due_after?: string;
  page?: number;
  limit?: number;
  sort_by?: 'due_at' | 'created_at' | 'status';

---

#### Single Assignment Routes (frontend/app/api/assignments/[id]/route.ts)
**Lines**: 700+

##### **Endpoint 3: GET /api/assignments/:id**
**Purpose**: Get single assignment with full details
**Auth**: School members (students see own, teachers see created, admins see all)
**Response**: AssignmentWithDetails including:
- Student and teacher information
- Latest submission with attachments
- Grades (if reviewed/completed)
- Complete event history
- Computed fields (is_overdue, time_remaining)

**Joins**:
- `students` → `profiles` (display_name, email)
- `teachers` → `profiles` (display_name, email)

- `grades` → `rubric_criteria`
- `assignment_events` → `profiles` (actor names)

##### **Endpoint 4: PATCH /api/assignments/:id**
**Purpose**: Update assignment
**Auth**: Creator teacher or admin
**Validation**: Cannot update after submission
**Request**:
```typescript
{
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  due_at?: string;
}
```

**Auth**: Role-based (students can view, teachers can review/complete)
**Request**:
```typescript
{
  to_status: AssignmentStatus;
  reason?: string;
}
```
**Lifecycle Validation**:
- `assigned` → `viewed` (student marks as viewed)
- `viewed` → `submitted` (handled by /submit endpoint)
- `submitted` → `reviewed` (teacher reviews)
- `reviewed` → `completed` (teacher marks complete)
- `completed` → `reopened` (handled by /reopen endpoint)

**Side Effects**:
- Updates assignment status
- Creates `assignment_events` record
- Sends notifications:
  - `viewed`: Notifies teacher
  - `reviewed/completed`: Notifies student

---

#### Submission Route (frontend/app/api/assignments/[id]/submit/route.ts)

{
  text?: string;
  attachments?: string[];
}
```

- Detects resubmission (checks existing submissions)
- Automatically transitions status to 'submitted'

**Side Effects**:
- Creates `assignment_submissions` record
- Inserts attachments to `assignment_attachments`
- Updates assignment status to 'submitted'
- Creates `assignment_events` (type: "submitted" or "resubmitted")
- Dual notifications to teacher:
  - In-app notification (immediate)
  - Email notification (queued for background worker)

---

#### Reopen Route (frontend/app/api/assignments/[id]/reopen/route.ts)
**Lines**: 350+

{
  reason: string; // Required
}
```
**Business Rules**:
- Only completed assignments can be reopened
- Maximum 10 reopens per assignment (ASSIGNMENT_CONSTANTS.MAX_REOPEN_COUNT)
- Reason is mandatory for audit trail

**Side Effects**:
- Increments `reopen_count`
- Updates status to 'reopened'
- Creates `assignment_events` (includes reopen_count, remaining_reopens)
- Dual notifications to student:
  - In-app notification (immediate)
  - Email notification (queued) with reason

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All endpoints enforce school-level isolation through Supabase RLS:
- Automatic filtering by `school_id`
- Users can only access their school's data
- No cross-school data leakage

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Implemented via permission validator functions:

| Operation | Owner | Admin | Teacher | Student | Parent |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| Create Assignment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own students) | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Assignment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own created) | ✅ (own) | ✅ (children) |
| Update Assignment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own created) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete Assignment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own created) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Submit Assignment | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (own) | ❌ |
| Mark as Viewed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own) | ❌ |
| Review/Complete | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own created) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reopen Assignment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own created) | ❌ | ❌ |

---

## 📊 Data Flow & Lifecycle

### Assignment Creation Flow
1. Teacher calls `POST /api/assignments`
2. Validates: auth, teacher role, student exists in same school
3. Creates assignment with status='assigned'
4. Creates assignment_events (type='created')
5. Returns assignment object

### Student Submission Flow
1. Student views assignment → `POST /api/assignments/:id/transition` (to_status='viewed')
2. Teacher notified of view
3. Student submits → `POST /api/assignments/:id/submit`
4. Creates submission record
5. Uploads attachments
6. Status changes to 'submitted'
7. Teacher notified (in-app + email)

### Teacher Review Flow
1. Teacher views submission details → `GET /api/assignments/:id`
2. Teacher reviews → `POST /api/assignments/:id/transition` (to_status='reviewed')
3. Student notified
4. Teacher completes → `POST /api/assignments/:id/transition` (to_status='completed')
5. Student notified
6. Optional: Teacher reopens → `POST /api/assignments/:id/reopen`
7. Student can resubmit (returns to step 3)

## 📝 Event Tracking & Audit Trail

Every operation creates an `assignment_events` record:

| Event Type | From Status | To Status | Actor | Metadata |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| created | null | assigned | Teacher | highlight_refs, initial_attachments |
| transition_assigned_to_viewed | assigned | viewed | Student | actor_role |
| submitted | viewed/reopened | submitted | Student | submission_id, has_text, attachment_count, is_resubmission |
| transition_submitted_to_reviewed | submitted | reviewed | Teacher | actor_role |
| transition_reviewed_to_completed | reviewed | completed | Teacher | actor_role |
| reopened | completed | reopened | Teacher | reason, reopen_count, remaining_reopens |
| updated | (any) | (same) | Teacher | updated_fields |

**Audit Benefits**:
- Complete history of all changes
- Actor tracking for accountability
- Reason tracking for reopens
- Metadata for business intelligence
- Compliance and reporting
