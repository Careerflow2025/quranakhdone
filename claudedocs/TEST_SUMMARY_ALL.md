✅ User management (teachers, students, parents)
✅ Multi-tenant data isolation
✅ Bulk operations
✅ Calendar and events system
✅ Secure credential management
✅ Row-level security
✅ Relationship management

The Next.js API route connectivity issue is a separate server problem that doesn't impact the underlying database functionality, which has been verified through direct Supabase client testing.

## Frontend Testing Results

### ✅ Test 14: Landing Page (PASS)
**Test Method**: Playwright browser testing

- **Page Load**: ✅ Landing page renders correctly
- **Navigation**: ✅ All navigation elements functional
- **UI Components**: ✅ Hero section, features grid, statistics, footer all working
- **Performance**: ✅ Page loads in < 3 seconds

---

### ✅ Test 15: Login Page (PASS)
**Test Method**: Playwright browser testing

- **Page Load**: ✅ Login page renders correctly
- **Form Elements**: ✅ Email/password inputs functional
- **Validation**: ✅ Form validation present
- **UI/UX**: ✅ Professional design, all elements accessible

---

### ✅ Test 16: Authentication System (PASS)
**Test Method**: Playwright automated login flow

- **Login Success**: ✅ Successfully authenticated with `wic@gmail.com`
- **Profile Retrieval**: ✅ User profile loaded correctly
- **Role Detection**: ✅ Owner role identified properly
- **Redirect Logic**: ✅ System initiated redirect to `/school-dashboard`

**Console Output**:
```
✅ Authentication successful: wic@gmail.com
✅ Profile found: {user_id: 132df292..., school_id: 63be947b..., role: owner}
🚀 Redirecting to: /school-dashboard for role: owner
```

---

### ❌ Test 17: School Dashboard Rendering (FAIL - CRITICAL)
**Test Method**: Playwright browser testing

- **Compilation**: ✅ Server compiled route successfully (816 modules in 6.9s)
- **Runtime Rendering**: ❌ Page loads but never completes rendering
- **Playwright Snapshot**: ❌ Timeout after 5000ms
- **Screenshot Capture**: ❌ Timeout after 5000ms
- **Page Interaction**: ❌ Page completely unresponsive

**Issue Description**:
The `/school-dashboard` route compiles without errors, but the page never reaches a "ready" state at runtime. This blocks all role-based UI testing.

**Probable Causes**:
1. Infinite render loop in React component
2. Async data fetching that never resolves
3. Component suspended waiting for data indefinitely
4. Circular dependency in component tree

**Impact**:
- ❌ Cannot test owner dashboard
- ❌ Cannot test teacher dashboard
- ❌ Cannot test student dashboard
- ❌ Cannot test parent dashboard
- ❌ Cannot perform end-to-end workflow testing

**Recommendation**: Manual browser testing with DevTools to identify root cause
