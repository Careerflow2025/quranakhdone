---

## ❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING (Critical Issues)

### 1. Teacher Workflow ❌ PARTIALLY WORKING (25% Pass Rate)
**Test**: `test_complete_teacher_workflow.js`
**Result**: ❌ FAIL (1/4 phases)

✅ **Phase 1 - API Creation**: PASS
- Teacher account creation via `/api/auth/create-teacher` works
- Returns valid credentials: email + password

❌ **Phase 2 - Database Verification**: FAIL
```
Error: TypeError: Headers.set: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." is an invalid header value.
```
**Root Cause**: Supabase service_role key being passed incorrectly to headers

❌ **Phase 3 - Login Success**: FAIL (skipped due to Phase 2 failure)

❌ **Phase 4 - Dashboard Rendered**: FAIL (skipped due to Phase 2 failure)

**Impact**: Teachers cannot be verified in database, blocking production deployment

---

### 2. All Dashboards Test ❌ COMPLETE FAILURE (0% Success)
**Test**: `test_all_dashboards.js`
**Result**: ❌ FAIL (0/3 accounts created)

All three account creations failed with identical error:
```
❌ Teacher creation failed: Unauthorized - please login
❌ Student creation failed: Unauthorized - please login
❌ Parent creation failed: Unauthorized - please login
```

**Root Cause**: Authentication not properly initialized in test script
**Impact**: Bulk testing workflow is broken

---

### 3. Homework Workflow ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE
**Test**: `test_homework_complete_workflow.js`
**Result**: ❌ FAIL (fetch failed)

```
⚠️  FAILED: Some phases failed. Review errors above.
Error: fetch failed
```

**Root Cause**: Network or API endpoint not accessible
**Impact**: Homework functionality cannot be verified

---

### 4. Missing E2E Tests for 8 Workflows ❌ HIGH RISK

**Test Files NOT Created**:
1. ❌ `test_targets_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #5 (Targets)
2. ❌ `test_gradebook_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #6 (Gradebook)
3. ❌ `test_messages_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #8 (Messages)
4. ❌ `test_mastery_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #11 (Mastery)
5. ❌ `test_calendar_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #12 (Calendar/Events) - **EXISTS** but not verified
6. ❌ `test_classes_complete_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #1 (Classes) - partial file exists
7. ❌ `test_assignments_complete_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #4 (Assignments) - **EXISTS** but not verified
8. ❌ `test_notifications_workflow.js` - WORKFLOW #9 (Notifications)

**Existing Test File Status**:
- ✅ `test_attendance_workflow.js` - EXISTS (373 lines) but requires clean dev environment
- ⚠️ `test_calendar.js`, `test_single_event.js`, `test_events_direct.js` - Partial calendar tests
- ⚠️ `test_classes_workflow.js`, `test_class_creation_workflow.js` - Partial classes tests
- ⚠️ `test_assignments_workflow.js` - Exists but not comprehensive

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Cannot verify 62% of workflows (8/13) are actually working end-to-end

---

## ⚠️ MEDIUM-RISK ISSUES

### 1. File Upload Functionality ⚠️ INCOMPLETE

**Messages Workflow**:
- UI has file upload button
- `POST /api/messages/[id]/attachments` endpoint exists
- **Missing**: Actual Supabase Storage implementation for file upload
- **Impact**: Users cannot send file attachments in messages

**Assignments Workflow**:
- UI has file upload capability
- Assignment attachments referenced in types
- **Missing**: Complete upload and download implementation
- **Impact**: Students cannot submit file attachments, teachers cannot attach resources

**Required Work**:
1. Configure Supabase Storage buckets
2. Implement upload logic with progress tracking
3. Implement download/view logic
4. Add file type validation
5. Add file size limits (currently defined as 10MB but not enforced)

---

### 2. Authentication Pattern Inconsistencies ⚠️

**Two Authentication Patterns Found**:

**Pattern 1**: Cookie-Based (Recommended)
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase-server';
const supabase = await createClient();
```
✅ Used in: Most endpoints
✅ Secure, session-based, production-standard

**Pattern 2**: Bearer Token
```typescript
import { getSupabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase-admin';
const supabase = getSupabaseAdmin();
```
⚠️ Used in: Some bulk operations, admin functions
⚠️ Requires service_role key management

**Issue**: Mixing patterns in same workflow (e.g., Attendance has both)
**Impact**: Potential security inconsistencies, harder to debug auth issues
**Recommendation**: Standardize on cookie-based authentication for all user-facing endpoints

---

### 3. Environment Variable Management ⚠️

**Missing**:
- ❌ No `.env.example` file for reference
- ❌ No documentation of required environment variables
- ❌ No validation of required variables at startup

**Required Variables** (inferred from code):
```
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=
```

**Impact**: Deployment will fail without proper variable configuration
**Recommendation**: Create `.env.example` with all required variables documented

---

### 4. Recipient List API Missing ⚠️

**Messages Workflow Issue**:
- **File**: `frontend/components/messages/MessagesPanel.tsx`
- **Line 83**: Uses mock data for recipient list
```typescript
// TODO: Replace with actual API call to get users in school
const mockRecipients = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Ahmed Al-Rahman', role: 'student' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Teacher Sarah', role: 'teacher' },
  { id: '3', name: 'Parent Ali', role: 'parent' },
];
setRecipients(mockRecipients);
```

**Required**: Create `/api/school/users` endpoint to return:
- All users in the school (students, teachers, parents, admins)
- Filter by role
- Search by name
- School isolation via RLS

**Impact**: Users cannot select real recipients when composing messages
