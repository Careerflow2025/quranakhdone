3. Integration point for mastery tracking
4. Most complex state machine to validate
5. High user impact if broken

**Test Script**: Create `test_assignments_complete_workflow.js`
**Expected Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Expected Outcome**: Complete validation of assignment lifecycle

## üìö Documentation Structure

For each feature tested, create:

**File**: `claudedocs/[FEATURE]_TEST_RESULTS_2025_10_21.md`

**Structure**:
1. Executive Summary
2. Test Results Overview
3. Detailed Phase Results
4. Technical Implementation Details
5. Bugs Found (if any)
6. Evidence Artifacts
7. Production Readiness Assessment
