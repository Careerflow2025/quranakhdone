### 🔧 4. ParentDashboard.tsx - CRITICAL BUG FIXED

**Issue Discovered**: Missing Authorization header on fetch call to /api/parents

**Bug Details**:
- **Line 90** (original): `fetch('/api/parents?school_id=...')` with only `credentials: 'include'`
- **Missing**: Authorization Bearer token header
- **Impact**: 401 Unauthorized errors, parent dashboard unable to load children data
- **Severity**: HIGH - Blocks entire parent workflow

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added supabase import
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';

// Added session verification (lines 91-97)
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
if (!session) {
  console.error('No session found for parent dashboard');
  setIsLoadingParent(false);
  return;
}

// Added Authorization header (lines 101-104)
const response = await fetch(`/api/parents?school_id=${user.schoolId}`, {
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`
  }
});
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Import added
- ✅ Session check added
- ✅ Authorization header added
- ✅ Follows same pattern as SchoolDashboard and all hooks
- ✅ Compatible with backend API expectations

**Result**: 🎉 **BUG FIXED - NOW 100% COMPATIBLE**
