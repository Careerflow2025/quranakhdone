## Architecture Overview

### Assignment Lifecycle Flow

```
Teacher Creates Assignment
    ↓
[POST /api/assignments] → Status: "assigned"
    ↓
Student Views Assignment
    ↓
[POST /api/assignments/:id/transition] → Status: "viewed"
    ↓
Student Submits Work
    ↓
[POST /api/assignments/:id/submit] → Status: "submitted"
    ↓
Teacher Reviews Submission
    ↓
[POST /api/assignments/:id/transition] → Status: "reviewed"
    ↓
Teacher Grades & Completes
    ↓
[POST /api/assignments/:id/transition] → Status: "completed"
    ↓
(Optional) Teacher Reopens
    ↓
[POST /api/assignments/:id/reopen] → Status: "reopened"
```

### Component Architecture

```
TeacherDashboard.tsx (line 893)
    ↓
<AssignmentsPanel userRole="teacher" />
    ↓
useAssignments() hook
    ↓
API Endpoints (/api/assignments/*)

StudentDashboard.tsx (line 1155)
    ↓
<AssignmentsPanel userRole="student" studentId={studentInfo.id} />
    ↓
useAssignments(studentId) hook
    ↓
API Endpoints (/api/assignments/*)
```

## Previous Documentation Gap

### WORKFLOW_4_COMPLETE.md (October 21, 2025)

**Status Claimed**: "Backend Complete ✅ | Frontend Integration Pending ⚠️"

**What Was Missing**:
- Documented backend bug fix (supabase → supabaseAdmin line 370)
- Listed "Remaining Work: Frontend Integration" sections
- Time estimates: 6-8 hours for frontend work
- Stated "Frontend: NOT PRODUCTION READY ❌"

**What Actually Existed**:
- ✅ useAssignments hook (716 lines) - already created Oct 20
- ✅ AssignmentsPanel (985 lines) - already created and integrated
- ✅ Dashboard integration - both dashboards already using component
- ✅ All 9 API endpoints working with full hook integration

**Conclusion**: Documentation was outdated by 1-2 days. Frontend work had been completed but not documented.

## Performance Considerations

### Pagination Strategy
- Default: 20 assignments per page
- Reduces initial load time
- Server-side pagination via API
- Client-side page navigation

### Filter Optimization
- Filters applied server-side
- Reduces data transfer
- Fast response times
- Cache-friendly queries

### Auto-Refresh Pattern
- Refresh after create/update/delete operations
- Ensures UI consistency
- Uses same fetchAssignments function
- Maintains current page/filters

### Loading States
- `isLoading` for initial fetch
- `isSubmitting` for mutations
- Separate states prevent UI flicker
- User feedback during operations

---

## Security Features

### Authentication
- All API calls use session cookies
- Bearer token for admin operations
- Auto-redirect if unauthenticated

### Authorization
- Role-based operation permissions
- Teacher can only modify own assignments
- Students can only submit own assignments
- School isolation enforced (RLS)

### Data Validation
- Type checking via TypeScript
- API-side validation
- Status transition rules enforced
- Due date validation

### Audit Trail
- All operations logged in assignment_events
- Actor tracking
- Timestamp recording
- Status change history

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Bulk Assignment Creation ⏳
**Enhancement**: Assign same task to multiple students/classes
**Use Case**: Class-wide assignments
**Implementation**:
```typescript
const createBulkAssignments = async (
  studentIds: string[],
  assignmentData: CreateAssignmentData
) => {
  const promises = studentIds.map(id =>
    createAssignment({ ...assignmentData, student_id: id })
  );
  return await Promise.all(promises);
};
```

### 2. Assignment Templates ⏳
**Enhancement**: Save frequently used assignments as templates
**Features**:
- Template library
- Quick template selection
- Pre-filled forms
- Version control

### 3. Advanced Filtering ⏳
**Enhancement**: Multi-criteria filtering with save presets
**Features**:
- Combine multiple filters
- Save filter combinations
- Quick filter presets
- Export filtered results

### 4. Real-Time Updates ⏳
**Enhancement**: WebSocket notifications for assignment changes
**Use Cases**:
- Student submits → Teacher notified immediately
- Teacher grades → Student sees update instantly
- Live badge counter updates

### 5. Offline Support ⏳
**Enhancement**: Cache assignments for offline viewing
**Benefits**:
- Students can view assignments without internet
- Progressive Web App capability
- Better mobile experience

### 6. File Upload Integration ⏳
**Enhancement**: Direct file upload to Supabase Storage
**Features**:
- Drag-and-drop upload
- Multiple file types
- Preview functionality
- Storage quota management

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Documentation Currency
**Issue**: Documentation (WORKFLOW_4_COMPLETE.md) didn't reflect actual completion state
**Learning**: Always verify code state before documentation claims
**Prevention**: Add "last verified" timestamps to documentation

### 2. Component Reusability
**Success**: AssignmentsPanel serves both teacher and student roles
**Pattern**: Single component with role-based rendering
**Benefit**: Code reuse, consistent UX, easier maintenance

### 3. Hook Pattern Consistency
**Success**: useAssignments follows same pattern as useParents, useStudents, useHomework
**Benefits**:
- Developer familiarity
- Predictable API
- Easy to extend
- Testing consistency

### 4. Separation of Concerns
**Success**: Hook (logic) vs Component (UI) separation
**Benefits**:
- Independent testing
- Easier refactoring
- Logic reusability
- Clear boundaries
