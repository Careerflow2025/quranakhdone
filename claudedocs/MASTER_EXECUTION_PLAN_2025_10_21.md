1. ✅ WORKFLOW #1: Classes - DONE
2. ✅ WORKFLOW #2: Parent Linking - DONE
3. ✅ WORKFLOW #4: Assignments - DONE
4. 🔴 WORKFLOW #8: Messages - IMPLEMENT (6-8 hours)
5. 🔴 WORKFLOW #5: Targets - INVESTIGATE
6. 🔴 WORKFLOW #6: Gradebook - INVESTIGATE
7. 🔴 WORKFLOW #7: Attendance - INVESTIGATE

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
8. ✅ WORKFLOW #3: Homework - DONE (verify)
9. 🔴 WORKFLOW #10: Student Management - INVESTIGATE
10. 🔴 WORKFLOW #11: Mastery Tracking - INVESTIGATE

**LOW PRIORITY**:
11. 🔴 WORKFLOW #12: Calendar/Events - INVESTIGATE
12. 🔴 WORKFLOW #13: Dashboard UI Forms - INVESTIGATE
13. 🟡 WORKFLOW #9: Notifications - SKIP (user confirmed)

---

### PHASE 2: Complete All Frontend Integrations

**Order**: Same as Phase 1 (high → medium → low)

For each workflow:
1. Identify frontend component (XxxPanel.tsx)
2. Replace local state with API fetch calls
3. Add Bearer token authentication
4. Test component in isolation
5. Document changes

**Estimated Time per Workflow**:
- Simple (Classes, Parent Link): 1-2 hours each
- Medium (Homework, Targets): 2-3 hours each
- Complex (Assignments, Gradebook): 4-6 hours each
- Very Complex (Messages): 2-3 hours (frontend already done)

---

### PHASE 3: End-to-End Testing

For each workflow:
1. Create test script (test_xxx_e2e.js)
2. Test: Create → Read → Update → Delete flow
3. Verify: Database persistence
4. Verify: UI updates correctly
5. Verify: Authentication/authorization
6. Document: Working vs broken features

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Create operation works
- ✅ Read/List operation works
- ✅ Update operation works
- ✅ Delete operation works
- ✅ School isolation enforced
- ✅ UI displays data correctly
- ✅ UI updates persist
