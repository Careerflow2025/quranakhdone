## 💻 Phase 14 Implementation

### Complete Work Delivered

**1. useMessages Custom Hook Created** ✅
- **File**: `frontend/hooks/useMessages.ts` (428 lines)

  - Reply to message function with automatic recipient determination
  - Mark as read function with optimistic UI updates
  - Fetch thread function for complete conversation view
  - Change folder/page functions for navigation
  - Error handling and loading states

- **File**: `frontend/components/messages/MessagesPanel.tsx` (698 lines)
- **Features**:
  - **Folder Tabs**: inbox, sent, unread, all with unread badge

## 🔧 Technical Patterns Applied

### Hook Patterns (useMessages.ts)
- **State Management**: useState for messages, pagination, loading, errors
- **Effect Hooks**: useEffect for initial data fetch
- **Callback Hooks**: useCallback for all functions to prevent recreation
- **Auth Integration**: useAuthStore for user context
- **API Integration**: fetch calls to all 6 Messages API endpoints
- **Optimistic Updates**: Update local state immediately for mark-as-read

### Component Patterns (MessagesPanel.tsx)
- **Client Component**: 'use client' directive for Next.js 13+
- **Modal Management**: useState for showComposeModal, showThreadModal
- **Form Management**: useState for composeForm, replyBody
- **Conditional Rendering**: {activeTab === 'messages' &&} pattern
- **Loading States**: isLoading, isSubmitting states with spinners
- **Error Boundaries**: error state with error message display
- **Empty States**: No messages empty state with helpful text

### Integration Patterns
- **Role-Based Props**: userRole prop passed to MessagesPanel
- **Tab Integration**: Conditional rendering based on activeTab state
- **Clean Replacement**: Remove old implementations, add new component
- **Import Management**: Add imports at file top, maintain alphabetical order
- **Backup Strategy**: Create .backup files before major modifications
