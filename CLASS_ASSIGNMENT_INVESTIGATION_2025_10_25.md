# Class Assignment Investigation Report

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Issue**: User reports class assignment not working (was working before)
**Status**: üîç INVESTIGATING

## Investigation Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Database Operations ARE Working**
   - Recent assignments saved just minutes ago (2025-10-24 23:54:28)
   - `class_teachers` table: 29 rows (last updated today)
   - `class_enrollments` table: 75 rows (last updated today)
   - Data is being persisted correctly

2. **RLS Policies Exist and Are Configured**
   ```sql
   -- class_teachers policies:
   - class_teachers_manage_owner_admin (ALL operations for owner/admin)
   - class_teachers_select_own_school (SELECT for same school)

   -- class_enrollments policies:
   - class_enrollments_manage_owner_admin (ALL operations for owner/admin)
   - class_enrollments_select_relevant (SELECT for relevant users)
   ```

3. **ClassBuilderUltra Component Logic**
   - Save function correctly deletes old assignments
   - Inserts new teacher assignments to `class_teachers`
   - Inserts new student enrollments to `class_enrollments`
   - Calls `onSave()` callback to refresh parent data

### ‚ùì Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **Frontend Display Issue**
   - Data saved but UI not refreshing to show assignments
   - Need to check if `onSave` callback is properly refreshing parent component

2. **Authorization Context**
   - RLS policies require owner/admin role
   - User might not have correct role in session
   - `current_user_context` view might not be returning correct role

3. **Error Handling**
   - Errors might be silently failing
   - Need to check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Need to check server logs for RLS policy violations

4. **School Context Mismatch**
   - User might be viewing assignments from different school
   - Data exists but filtered out by RLS policies

## Next Steps

### Need User Input
Please provide the following information:

1. **What specifically is not working?**
   - Can you drag/drop teachers and students?
   - Does the "Save Changes" button work?
   - Do you see any error messages?
   - Does the UI show the assignments after saving?

2. **Browser Console Errors**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Try to assign a teacher or student to a class
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Copy any RED error messages that appear

3. **When did it stop working?**
   - What was the last change made before it broke?
   - Did anything else change (database migration, code update)?

4. **User Role Verification**
   - What role is your current user? (owner/admin/teacher)
   - Are you logged in as the school owner/admin?

### Technical Verification Needed

```sql
-- Verify current user has owner/admin role
SELECT
  p.user_id,
  p.email,
  p.role,
  p.school_id,
  s.name as school_name
FROM profiles p
JOIN schools s ON s.id = p.school_id
WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid();
```

### Code Areas to Check

1. **SchoolDashboard.tsx** - Check `onSave` callback for ClassBuilderUltra
2. **useSchoolData.ts** - Check `refreshData` function
3. **Browser Network Tab** - Check for failed API requests
4. **Supabase Logs** - Check for RLS policy violations

## Hypothesis

**Most Likely Issue**: Frontend refresh problem
- Data IS being saved successfully (confirmed via database)
- UI might not be refreshing after save
- User sees old data even though new data exists

**Second Most Likely**: Authorization context issue
- User session might not have correct role
- RLS policies blocking operations despite user being owner/admin
- Need to verify `current_user_context` returns correct values

**Least Likely**: Database/backend issue
- Database operations proven to work (recent data exists)
- RLS policies are configured
- Would cause complete failure, not intermittent issues

## Files Involved

- `frontend/components/dashboard/ClassBuilderUltra.tsx` (lines 624-675: saveChanges function)
- `frontend/components/dashboard/SchoolDashboard.tsx` (ClassBuilderUltra integration)
- `frontend/hooks/useSchoolData.ts` (data refresh logic)
- Database: `class_teachers`, `class_enrollments` tables
- RLS Policies: `class_teachers_manage_owner_admin`, `class_enrollments_manage_owner_admin`

## Evidence Collected

```
Recent class_teachers entries:
- memorization class: teacher assigned at 23:54:28
- hifdh class: teacher assigned at 23:54:27
- gg class: teacher assigned at 23:54:26

Recent class_enrollments entries:
- memorization class: 2 students enrolled at 23:54:29
- hifdh class: 3 students enrolled at 23:54:28
```

**Conclusion**: Backend is working. Issue is likely frontend display or user authorization context.
