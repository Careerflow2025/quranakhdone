# Supabase RLS Policy Guide - Production Configuration

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide to manually configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase for 100% reliable user management operations.

**Target**: Production-grade setup supporting school registration, login, and complete user management (teachers, students, parents).

## 🎯 Architecture Overview: Hybrid System

### The Two-Layer Security Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 1: SERVER-SIDE OPERATIONS (Service Role Key)        │
│  ✅ Create users (teachers, students, parents)              │
│  ✅ Delete users                                             │
│  ✅ School registration                                      │
│  → BYPASSES RLS completely                                  │
│  → 100% reliable, no RLS blocking                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 2: CLIENT-SIDE OPERATIONS (RLS Protected)           │
│  ✅ Read user data (dashboards, lists)                      │
│  ✅ Update user profiles                                     │
│  ✅ Login and authentication                                 │
│  → PROTECTED BY RLS policies                                │
│  → Requires proper policies for school isolation            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Principle: **Server Creates, RLS Protects Reads**

- **Server-side API endpoints** (already implemented) handle ALL creation/deletion operations
- **RLS policies** control read access and ensure school data isolation
- **Result**: Creation operations never fail, reads are properly secured

---

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before implementing policies:

- [ ] Access to Supabase Dashboard (https://app.supabase.com)
- [ ] Navigate to your project
- [ ] Open SQL Editor (left sidebar)
- [ ] Backup existing policies (if any)
- [ ] Confirm `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in Netlify environment variables

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Implementation

### SECTION 1: School Registration & Login Policies

**Purpose**: Allow school registration and enable owner/admin login

#### Step 1.1: Enable RLS on Core Tables

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all core tables
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE schools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE teachers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE students ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE parents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE parent_students ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Why**: RLS must be enabled for policies to take effect. Without RLS, tables are open to all operations.

---

#### Step 1.2: Create Helper Function for Current User

```sql
-- Helper function to get current user's school_id
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.user_school_id()
RETURNS UUID AS $$
  SELECT school_id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
$$ LANGUAGE SQL SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Why**: This function safely retrieves the current authenticated user's school_id, used in all policies for school isolation.

---

#### Step 1.3: Profiles Table Policies (School Registration & Login)

```sql
-- PROFILES: SELECT - Users can read their own profile
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select_own" ON profiles;
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_own"
  ON profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- PROFILES: SELECT - School owners/admins can read all profiles in their school
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select_school" ON profiles;
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_school"
  ON profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles p
      WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND p.role IN ('owner', 'admin')
      AND p.school_id = profiles.school_id
    )
  );

-- PROFILES: UPDATE - Users can update their own profile
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_own" ON profiles;
CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_own"
  ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- PROFILES: UPDATE - School owners/admins can update profiles in their school
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_school" ON profiles;
CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_school"
  ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles p
      WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND p.role IN ('owner', 'admin')
      AND p.school_id = profiles.school_id
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- PROFILES: INSERT - Allow Service Role Key to insert (server-side only)
-- Note: No INSERT policy for client-side = only server can insert via Service Role Key
-- This is intentional - registration happens server-side only

-- PROFILES: DELETE - Only Service Role Key can delete (server-side only)
-- Note: No DELETE policy for client-side = only server can delete via Service Role Key
```

**Why Each Policy**:
- `profiles_select_own`: Users must read their own profile during login
- `profiles_select_school`: Owners/admins need to see all users in their school
- `profiles_update_own`: Users can update their own information
- `profiles_update_school`: Owners/admins can update user profiles
- No INSERT/DELETE: Server-side only (Service Role Key bypasses RLS)

---

#### Step 1.4: Schools Table Policies

```sql
-- SCHOOLS: SELECT - Users can read their own school
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "schools_select_own" ON schools;
CREATE POLICY "schools_select_own"
  ON schools
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- SCHOOLS: UPDATE - Only school owners can update school info
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "schools_update_owner" ON schools;
CREATE POLICY "schools_update_owner"
  ON schools
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    id = auth.user_school_id()
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role = 'owner'
      AND school_id = schools.id
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- SCHOOLS: INSERT/DELETE - Only Service Role Key (server-side)
-- No client-side INSERT/DELETE policies
```

**Why**:
- `schools_select_own`: Users need to read their school information
- `schools_update_owner`: Only school owners can modify school settings
- No INSERT/DELETE: School creation/deletion is server-side only

---

### SECTION 2: Teacher Management Policies

**Purpose**: Enable school owners/admins to view, update teachers (creation/deletion is server-side)

#### Step 2.1: Teachers Table Policies

```sql
-- TEACHERS: SELECT - School owners/admins/teachers can read teachers in their school
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "teachers_select_school" ON teachers;
CREATE POLICY "teachers_select_school"
  ON teachers
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- TEACHERS: UPDATE - School owners/admins can update teachers
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "teachers_update_school" ON teachers;
CREATE POLICY "teachers_update_school"
  ON teachers
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
      AND school_id = teachers.school_id
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- TEACHERS: UPDATE - Teachers can update their own info
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "teachers_update_own" ON teachers;
CREATE POLICY "teachers_update_own"
  ON teachers
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- TEACHERS: INSERT/DELETE - Only Service Role Key (server-side)
-- No client-side INSERT/DELETE policies
```

**Why**:
- `teachers_select_school`: Dashboard needs to display all teachers
- `teachers_update_school`: Admins need to edit teacher details
- `teachers_update_own`: Teachers can update their own profile
- No INSERT/DELETE: Teacher creation/deletion uses `/api/school/create-teacher` and `/api/school/delete-teachers`

---

### SECTION 3: Student Management Policies

**Purpose**: Enable school staff to view, update students (creation/deletion is server-side)

#### Step 3.1: Students Table Policies

```sql
-- STUDENTS: SELECT - School owners/admins/teachers can read students in their school
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "students_select_school" ON students;
CREATE POLICY "students_select_school"
  ON students
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- STUDENTS: SELECT - Students can read their own record
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "students_select_own" ON students;
CREATE POLICY "students_select_own"
  ON students
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- STUDENTS: SELECT - Parents can read their children's records
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "students_select_parent" ON students;
CREATE POLICY "students_select_parent"
  ON students
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT ps.student_id
      FROM parent_students ps
      JOIN parents p ON p.id = ps.parent_id
      WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- STUDENTS: UPDATE - School owners/admins/teachers can update students
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "students_update_school" ON students;
CREATE POLICY "students_update_school"
  ON students
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'teacher')
      AND school_id = students.school_id
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- STUDENTS: UPDATE - Students can update their own limited fields
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "students_update_own" ON students;
CREATE POLICY "students_update_own"
  ON students
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- STUDENTS: INSERT/DELETE - Only Service Role Key (server-side)
-- No client-side INSERT/DELETE policies
```

**Why**:
- `students_select_school`: Dashboard needs to display all students
- `students_select_own`: Students view their own profile
- `students_select_parent`: Parents see their children's information
- `students_update_school`: Staff can edit student details
- `students_update_own`: Students can update their own info
- No INSERT/DELETE: Student creation/deletion uses `/api/school/create-student` and `/api/school/delete-students`

---

### SECTION 4: Parent Management Policies

**Purpose**: Enable school staff and parents to view, update parent records (creation/deletion is server-side)

#### Step 4.1: Parents Table Policies

```sql
-- PARENTS: SELECT - School owners/admins/teachers can read parents in their school
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "parents_select_school" ON parents;
CREATE POLICY "parents_select_school"
  ON parents
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- PARENTS: SELECT - Parents can read their own record
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "parents_select_own" ON parents;
CREATE POLICY "parents_select_own"
  ON parents
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- PARENTS: UPDATE - School owners/admins can update parents
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "parents_update_school" ON parents;
CREATE POLICY "parents_update_school"
  ON parents
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
      AND school_id = parents.school_id
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    school_id = auth.user_school_id()
  );

-- PARENTS: UPDATE - Parents can update their own info
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "parents_update_own" ON parents;
CREATE POLICY "parents_update_own"
  ON parents
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- PARENTS: INSERT/DELETE - Only Service Role Key (server-side)
-- No client-side INSERT/DELETE policies
```

**Why**:
- `parents_select_school`: Dashboard needs to display all parents
- `parents_select_own`: Parents view their own profile
- `parents_update_school`: Admins can edit parent details
- `parents_update_own`: Parents can update their own info
- No INSERT/DELETE: Parent creation/deletion uses `/api/school/create-parent` and `/api/school/delete-parents`

---

#### Step 4.2: Parent-Student Linking Table Policies

```sql
-- PARENT_STUDENTS: SELECT - School owners/admins/teachers can read links
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "parent_students_select_school" ON parent_students;
CREATE POLICY "parent_students_select_school"
  ON parent_students
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM parents p
      WHERE p.id = parent_students.parent_id
      AND p.school_id = auth.user_school_id()
    )
  );

-- PARENT_STUDENTS: SELECT - Parents can read their own links
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "parent_students_select_own" ON parent_students;
CREATE POLICY "parent_students_select_own"
  ON parent_students
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    parent_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM parents WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- PARENT_STUDENTS: SELECT - Students can see who their parents are
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "parent_students_select_student" ON parent_students;
CREATE POLICY "parent_students_select_student"
  ON parent_students
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    student_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM students WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- PARENT_STUDENTS: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE - Only Service Role Key (server-side)
-- No client-side INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies
-- Parent-student linking happens server-side during parent creation
```

**Why**:
- `parent_students_select_school`: Dashboard displays parent-student relationships
- `parent_students_select_own`: Parents see their children
- `parent_students_select_student`: Students see their parents
- No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Linking managed server-side during parent creation/update

     sp.display_name as student_name
   FROM parents p
   JOIN profiles pr ON pr.user_id = p.user_id
   JOIN parent_students ps ON ps.parent_id = p.id

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Profile not found" during login
**Cause**: Profile doesn't exist or SELECT policy blocking read

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Check if profile exists
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'user-email@example.com';

-- If missing, check auth.users
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'user-email@example.com';

-- If auth user exists but no profile, manually create:
INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, school_id, email, display_name, role)
VALUES (
  'user-id-from-auth-users',
  'school-id',
  'user-email@example.com',
  'User Name',
  'owner'
);
```

### Issue 2: "Credentials are invalid"
**Cause**: Usually not RLS-related, but authentication configuration

**Check**:
1. Verify email/password are correct
2. Check Supabase Authentication settings
3. Verify email confirmation settings:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
   - Check "Enable email confirmations"
   - For testing: Consider disabling temporarily

### Issue 3: Users can't see their dashboard data
**Cause**: Missing SELECT policies or helper function

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Verify helper function exists
SELECT auth.user_school_id();

-- Verify SELECT policies exist
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'schools', 'teachers', 'students', 'parents')
AND cmd = 'SELECT';
```

### Issue 4: Teacher/Student/Parent creation still fails
**Cause**: If creation fails, it's NOT an RLS issue (Service Role Key bypasses RLS)

**Check**:
1. Verify environment variables in Netlify:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
2. Check server logs for actual error
3. Verify API endpoints exist:
   - `/api/school/create-teacher`
   - `/api/school/create-student`
   - `/api/school/create-parent`

### Issue 5: Parents not linked to children
**Cause**: `parent_students` table policies or server-side linking issue

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Check if links exist
SELECT * FROM parent_students WHERE parent_id = 'parent-id';

-- Verify parent_students SELECT policies
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'parent_students';

-- If links missing, check API logs for errors during parent creation
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Hybrid System

### Why This Approach is Production-Grade

**Traditional Approach (Problematic)**:
```
Client → Supabase Client Library → Database
         ↓
    RLS Policies CHECK
         ↓
    ❌ BLOCKED (intermittent failures)
```

**Hybrid Approach (Production-Grade)**:
```
CREATE/DELETE Operations:
Client → Next.js API Route → Supabase Admin (Service Role Key) → Database
                                     ↓
                             BYPASSES RLS
                                     ↓
                             ✅ 100% SUCCESS

READ/UPDATE Operations:
Client → Supabase Client Library → Database
         ↓
    RLS Policies CHECK
         ↓
    ✅ ALLOWED (with proper policies)
```

### Benefits of Hybrid System

1. **Reliability**: Creation/deletion operations never fail (Service Role Key bypasses RLS)
2. **Security**: Read operations properly isolated by school via RLS policies
3. **Scalability**: Handles millions of users without RLS interference on critical paths
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between privileged (server) and regular (client) operations
5. **Auditability**: Server-side operations are logged and traceable

### When to Use Each Layer

**Use Server-Side (Service Role Key)**:
- User creation (teachers, students, parents)
- User deletion
- School registration
- Bulk operations
- Any operation requiring 100% reliability

**Use Client-Side (RLS Protected)**:
- Displaying dashboard data
- User profile updates
- Login/authentication
- Real-time subscriptions
- Interactive UI operations

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues after implementing these policies:

1. **Check Supabase Logs**:
   - Dashboard → Logs → API Logs
   - Look for RLS policy errors

2. **Verify Policy Installation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
   FROM pg_policies
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
   GROUP BY tablename
   ORDER BY tablename;
   ```
