## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select project: **rlfvubgyogkkqbjjmjwd** (East US)
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Execute Database Schema

**File Location**: `supabase/migrations/20251016000001_complete_production_schema.sql`

#### Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Open SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy the entire contents of `20251016000001_complete_production_schema.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. Wait for completion (should take 10-30 seconds)
7. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

#### Option B: Via Supabase CLI

```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
cd C:\quranakhfinalproduction
npx supabase db push

# Or execute specific migration
psql "postgresql://postgres:vQAZjPh54Hnp_$#@db.rlfvubgyogkkqbjjmjwd.supabase.co:5432/postgres" -f supabase/migrations/20251016000001_complete_production_schema.sql
```

### Step 3: Apply Row Level Security Policies

1. In SQL Editor, click **New Query**
2. Copy contents of `20251016000002_rls_policies.sql`
3. Paste and **Run**
4. Wait for completion

### Step 4: Verify Database Setup

Run this verification query:

```sql
-- Verify all tables were created
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Should return 35+ tables including:
-- schools, profiles, teachers, students, parents
-- classes, attendance, highlights, notes
-- assignments, homework, targets, messages, etc.

-- Verify Quran scripts were seeded
SELECT * FROM quran_scripts;

-- Should return 6 scripts:
-- uthmani-hafs, warsh, qaloon, al-duri, al-bazzi, qunbul

-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND rowsecurity = true;

-- Should show all tables with RLS enabled
```

FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'voice-notes' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM teachers
    WHERE teachers.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Students and parents can view assigned voice notes

      SELECT 1 FROM notes n
      JOIN highlights h ON h.id = n.highlight_id
      JOIN students s ON s.id = h.student_id
      JOIN parent_students ps ON ps.student_id = s.id
      JOIN parents p ON p.id = ps.parent_id
