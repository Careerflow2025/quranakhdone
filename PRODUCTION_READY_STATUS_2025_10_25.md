## ⚠️ Security Advisors (Pre-Existing)

The following security advisors were detected but are **NOT related to the workflow fix**. These are existing database configuration issues that should be addressed separately:

**Critical Issues** (2):
1. `quran_scripts` table: RLS enabled but policies exist (needs RLS enabled)
2. `current_user_context` view: SECURITY DEFINER property

**Warnings** (4):
- Function search_path mutable for 4 functions
- Leaked password protection disabled

**Info Issues** (13):
- Multiple tables have RLS enabled but no policies

**Note**: These issues existed before the workflow fix and do not block production testing of the highlights → assignments feature.
