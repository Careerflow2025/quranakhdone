## üêõ CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED & FIXED

### Bug Details
**Severity**: üö® **CRITICAL**
**Impact**: 100% notification failure rate
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

### The Issue
During production testing, server log monitoring revealed a database constraint violation error appearing on EVERY homework creation:

```
code: '23502'
message: 'null value in column "title" of relation "notifications" violates not-null constraint'
```

### Root Cause
The homework creation endpoint (`/api/homework`) was missing required database fields (`title` and `body`) in TWO notification insert statements:
1. In-app notification (lines 228-247)
2. Email notification (lines 254-271)

### Why This Was Critical
- **Zero notifications** were being saved to database (100% failure rate)
- Error was **silently swallowed** by error handling that didn't fail the request
- Tests appeared to pass while production system was broken
- This type of bug could have caused serious production issues

### The Fix
Added missing `title` and `body` fields to both notification inserts in:
```
File: C:\quranakhfinalproduction\frontend\app\api\homework\route.ts
Lines: 235-236, 260-261
```

### Verification
- ‚úÖ 42/42 tests passing on port 3020 (clean server)
- ‚úÖ ZERO "Notification creation error" messages in server logs
- ‚úÖ All homework creation now successfully saves notifications
- ‚úÖ Dual-channel notifications (in_app + email) both working
