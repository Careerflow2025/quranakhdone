## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Assignment Lifecycle (6 States)
```
assigned → viewed → submitted → reviewed → completed → reopened
   📋       👁️        📤          🔍          ✅           🔄
  (blue)  (purple)  (yellow)   (orange)    (green)      (red)
```

### Valid State Transitions
```typescript
assigned  → viewed     (Student views assignment)
viewed    → submitted  (Student submits work)
submitted → reviewed   (Teacher reviews submission)
reviewed  → completed  (Teacher marks as complete)
completed → reopened   (Teacher requests resubmission, max 10x)
reopened  → submitted  (Student resubmits)
```

### Role-Based Permissions
- **Teachers**: Create, update, delete, review, complete, reopen
- **Students**: View, submit, resubmit (when reopened)
- **Parents**: View-only access to children's assignments

  ✓ Delete assignments (before submission)
  ✓ Review submissions (submitted → reviewed)
  ✓ Complete assignments (reviewed → completed)
  ✓ Reopen assignments (completed → reopened, max 10x)
  ✓ View all students' assignments
  ✗ Cannot submit as student

Students:
  ✓ View own assignments
  ✓ Submit assignments (viewed/reopened → submitted)
  ✓ View own submissions
  ✗ Cannot create, update, delete
  ✗ Cannot review or complete
  ✗ Cannot view other students' assignments

Parents:
  ✓ View children's assignments (read-only)
  ✗ Cannot create, update, delete
  ✗ Cannot submit or review
  ✗ View only linked children
```

### Input Validation
- Title: Required, max 200 characters
- Description: Optional, max 5,000 characters
- Due date: Required, ISO 8601 format

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Well
1. **Pattern Consistency**: Following Phases 14-17 exactly made implementation smooth
2. **Discovery First**: Analyzing all 6 API endpoints prevented rework
3. **Comprehensive Component**: Building all interfaces in one component avoided fragmentation
4. **Memory Documentation**: Continuous memory updates preserved all context
5. **Todo Tracking**: Clear task breakdown made progress visible

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Large Content Replacement**: StudentDashboard (150 lines) and ParentDashboard (81 lines) had custom content that needed careful replacement
2. **Sed Command Syntax**: Extra closing braces in sed replacement required manual fixes
3. **Role-Based Props**: Different dashboards required different studentId patterns (own vs selected child)

### Best Practices Confirmed
1. **Read Before Edit**: Always read files before modifying to understand structure
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Reading all API files in parallel saved time
3. **Pattern Reuse**: Copying exact patterns from previous phases ensured consistency
4. **Incremental Validation**: Checking each integration immediately after creation
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Session summaries preserve complete knowledge
