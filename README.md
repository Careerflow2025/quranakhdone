## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM

### **Key Concepts**

**1. Page-Based Progress**
- Progress is calculated by PAGES, not individual highlights
- A page only counts as complete when ALL highlights are gold
- Formula: `(Complete Pages / Total Pages) × 100`

**2. Green → Gold Workflow**
- Teacher creates GREEN highlight = Homework
- Student completes work
- Teacher marks complete
- System automatically changes to GOLD
- Real-time update to all viewers

**3. Version Locking**
- Teacher selects Quran version on first Student Management visit
- Version locks for that student forever
- Prevents confusion from switching scripts mid-learning

**4. Two Communication Systems**
- **Notes**: Attached to highlights, teacher ↔ student, parent can view
- **Messages**: General communication, any ↔ any based on permissions

**5. Auto Practice Tracking**
- Automatic timer when student on Quran page
- 2-minute idle detection
- No manual start/stop needed
- Daily/weekly/monthly reports

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SYSTEM RULES

### **DO NOT**
- ❌ Allow schools to create homework (teachers only!)
- ❌ Let students change their passwords
- ❌ Allow parents to reply in highlight notes
- ❌ Skip version locking after first selection
- ❌ Count pages as complete if any highlight is not gold

### **ALWAYS**
- ✅ Isolate school data via RLS
- ✅ Validate all user inputs
- ✅ Send real-time notifications on gold completion
- ✅ Track practice time automatically
- ✅ Email credentials when creating users

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues**

**1. Environment Variables Not Loading**
- Ensure `.env.local` exists in frontend folder
- Restart development server after changes
- Check variable names match exactly

**2. Authentication Errors**
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check RLS policies are enabled
- Ensure user has proper role assigned

**3. Real-time Updates Not Working**
- Confirm Supabase realtime is enabled
- Check WebSocket connections
- Verify subscription setup
